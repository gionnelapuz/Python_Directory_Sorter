# Python Directory Sorter
This is a python script that lets you sort files within a directory based on the file extension. I have created two scripts for sorting and they are **AutoSort** and **ManualSort**.

* Bullet list
              * Nested bullet
                  * Sub-nested bullet etc
          * Bullet list item 2

Basically the difference is that for **AutoSort** it will periodically check the folder and sort it without you needing to run the script over and over again, this is basically what I wanted so I just made this script, and the second script **ManualSort** lets you just run the script once if you need to use it.

# How to use
Just replace the paths on the on the **Settings variable** to where the files should go based on their extensions and if you want set a scheduler that would automatically sort the files.
